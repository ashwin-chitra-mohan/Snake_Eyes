Atheris rungweensis, commonly known as the Rungwe tree viper, Mt Rungwe bush viper, and Rungwe leaf viper, is a species of venomous viper found in East Africa.

Taxonomy
The specific name is derived from the species type locality in the Rungwe Mountains. It was formerly considered as a subspecies of Atheris nitschei.

Description
It grows to a maximum length (body + tail) of 65 cm (26 in). At midbody, it has 22–33 dorsal scale rows. The ventral scales number 150–165, and the subcaudals 46–58.The color pattern is variable, with a ground color that ranges from bright green to green to black. Usually, this is overlaid with a pair of yellow dorsolateral zigzag lines. A row of yellow spots on the sides of the ventral scales may also be present. Specimens from the Sumbawanga region usually have a green yellow and black color pattern. Neonates are a dark brown or gray, but with a bright yellow tail tip.
