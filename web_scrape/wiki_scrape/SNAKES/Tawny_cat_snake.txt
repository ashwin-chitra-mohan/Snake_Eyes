Geographic range
B. ochracea is found in the Andaman Islands, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India (Changlang District), Myanmar, and Nepal. It is also found in China.

Subspecies
Three subspecies are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
Boiga ochracea ochracea (Theobald, 1868)
Boiga ochracea stoliczkae (Wall, 1909)
Boiga ochracea walli M.A. Smith, 1943Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Boiga.

B. ochracea is oviparous.

Etymology
The subspecific names, stoliczkae and walli, are in honor of Moravian herpetologist Ferdinand Stoliczka and British herpetologist Frank Wall, respectively.
