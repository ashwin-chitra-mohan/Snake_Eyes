Dendrelaphis calligaster, also called green tree snake and northern tree snake, is a colubrid snake native to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia.
It is a slender, large-eyed, non-venomous, diurnal snake, which grows up to 1.2 m in length and is greenish, brown, or greyish above with a cream or yellow belly.This common snake is harmless, and readily recognised due to its cream to yellow belly and pronounced wide dark facial stripe passing across the eye.
