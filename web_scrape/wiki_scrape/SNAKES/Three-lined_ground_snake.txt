Atractus trilineatus, commonly known as the three-lined ground snake, is a species of small burrowing snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to South America.

Geographic range
A. trilineatus is found in northern South America, including the Caribbean island of Trinidad.

Habitat
The preferred natural habitat of A. trilineatus is forest and savanna, at altitudes from sea level to 500 m (1,600 ft), but it has also been found in agricultural and horticultural areas.

Description
A. trilineatus may attain a total length of 225 mm (8+3⁄4 in), including a short tail of 15 mm (1⁄2 in). Dorsally, it is brown with three or four darker longitudinal stripes; ventrally it is either uniform white, or has a few brown dots. The smooth dorsal scales are in 15 rows, and the anal plate is entire. The ventrals number 125–150, and subcaudals only 11–19.

Diet
A. trilineatus is believed to prey upon soft-bodied insects and earthworms, as well as fish and tadpoles.

Reproduction
A. trilineatus is oviparous. Eggs are layed in March, May and August, and clutch size is three to five eggs.
