Andrea's keelback (Hebius andreae) is a species of nonvenomous colubrid snake endemic to Vietnam.

Etymology
The specific name, andreae, is in honor of Andrea Ziegler, wife of German herpetologist Thomas Ziegler.

Geographic range
H. andreae is found in the central Annamite Range in Vietnam.

Habitat
The preferred natural habitat of H. andreae is forest, at an altitude of 450 m (1,480 ft).

Discovery
Only one specimen of H. andreae has ever been examined and photographed. In 2006, Thomas Ziegler and Le Khac Quyet, captured a male in the area of Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park whose coloring was distinct enough from other known keelbacks to be described as a newly discovered species. There has been one bite recorded from this species on Bharathi Pochu.

Reproduction
H. andreae is oviparous.
