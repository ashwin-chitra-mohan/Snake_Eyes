Cerrophidion godmani is a venomous pit viper species native to southern Mexico and Guatemala. No subspecies are recognized as being valid. It is also known commonly as Godman's montane pit viper or Godman's pit viper.

Etymology
The specific name, godmani, is in honor of English zoologist Frederick DuCane Godman.

Description
Terrestrial and moderately stout, adults of C. godmani are usually less than 55 cm (21.5 in) in total length (including tail), but sometimes grow to more than 75 cm (30 in). The tail is non-prehensile and short. The dorsal scales are in 21 rows at midbody.

Geographic range
C. godmani is found in Mexico, in the Mexican states of Chiapas and southeastern Oaxaca, and in Guatemala. Populations from south of Guatemala are assigned to a new species, Cerrophidion sasai. The type locality for C. godmani given by Günther in 1863 is "near Dueñas and on other parts of the tableland of Guatemala".

Habitat
The preferred natural habitats of C. godmani are forest and grassland, at altitudes of 1,400–3,491 m (4,593–11,453 ft).

Behavior
C. godmani is terrestrial, and it is both diurnal and nocturnal.

Diet
Adults of C. godmani prey predominately upon small mammals, and will occasionally eat amphibians, reptiles, and birds. Juveniles eat mostly arthropods.

Reproduction
C. godmani is ovoviviparous.
