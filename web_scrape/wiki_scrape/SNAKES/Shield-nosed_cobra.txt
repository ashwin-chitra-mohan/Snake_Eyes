The shield-nosed cobra (Aspidelaps scutatus), or eastern shield-nose snake, is a venomous snake of the family Elapidae.The shield-nosed cobra is mainly found in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. They can survive between 20 and 28 years in captivity, though this age is normally not attained in the wild due to predation, accidents, etc. This species of snake is highly venomous, and has been attributed to at least one reported death of a human, despite its propensity to bite being somewhat low. The venom is highly neurotoxic, and no known antivenin is currently available for this species. Any bite or spit-sprayed venom from any elapid snake should be treated as an urgent medical emergency.
