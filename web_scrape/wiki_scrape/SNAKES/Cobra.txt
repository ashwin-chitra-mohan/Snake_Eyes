Cobra is the common name of various snakes, most of which belong to the genus Naja.

Biology
All of the known cobras are venomous and many are capable of rearing upwards and producing a hood when threatened.

Other snakes known as "cobras"
While the members of the genus Naja constitute the true cobras, the name cobra is also applied to these other genera and species:

The rinkhals, ringhals or ring-necked spitting cobra (Hemachatus haemachatus) so-called for its neck band as well as its habit of rearing upwards and producing a hood when threatened
The king cobra or hamadryad (Ophiophagus hannah)
The two species of tree cobras, Goldie's tree cobra (Pseudohaje goldii) and the black tree cobra (Pseudohaje nigra)
